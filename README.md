# What It Does

`DualCameraKit` is an iOS library that makes simultaneous front & back camera capture simple â€“ combining the view and the viewer in a single shot, as seen in apps like Snapchat and BeReal.

For simple, drop-in functionality, you can use `DualCameraScreen`, a SwiftUI View with buttons for photo capture, video recording, and toggling through the different dual-camera layouts and recording modes.

For deeper customizability, you can access the lower-level components that `DualCameraScreen` is built on

# Installing DualCameraKit

Since `DualCameraKit` is published using Swift Package Manager, you can install it by following these steps:

## In Xcode:

1. Go to **File > Add Packages...**
2. In the search bar, paste this [repository URL](https://github.com/Liampronan/DualCameraKit).
3. Select the version rule (e.g., "Up to Next Major" is recommended for most cases)
4. Click **Add Package**
5. Select the `DualCameraKit` library product
6. Click **Add Package** to complete the installation

## In Package.swift:

If you're developing a Swift package that depends on `DualCameraKit`, add it to your package dependencies:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://url-to-dualcamerakit-repo.git", from: $VERSION_STRING_HERE$)
],
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourTarget",
        dependencies: ["DualCameraKit"]
    )
]
```

## OS/Requirements:

- Add camera permissions to your app's `Info.plist` - `Privacy - Camera Usage Description`
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ef0ae3e-683c-444c-9276-4684efb08e5c" width=550 />

- Live, nonsimulator device, iOS 17+ for camera usage (simulator uses mocked camera).

After installation, you can import the library in your Swift files:

```swift
import DualCameraKit
```

# Running the DemoApp - Local Code Signing Setup

To get the demo app running, you'll need to:

1. set code signing to automatic,
2. select your development team - this dropdown appears after setting code signing to automatic

Since this library currently requires a real device, you cannot run it on a simulator.

# Overview - the three ways to use this library

Three are three different sets of components this library exposes, ranging from higher-level (drop-in, less customizable) to lower-level (more customizable). Each built on top of their lower level.

1. âœ… `DualCameraScreen`

- drop-in, least customizable.
- a full-screen SwiftUI view which with buttons for photo capture, video recording, and toggling through the different dual-camera layouts and recording modes.

2. ðŸš§ `DualCameraDisplayView` and `DualCameraController`

- medium customization - useful for using pre-configured dual camera layouts while customizing the control UI and post-capture behavior.
- the `DualCameraDisplayView` renders streams managed by the `DualCameraController`
- you're responsible for wiring up UI for photo capture, video recording managment, and layout config.

3. ðŸš§ Raw Components

- full customization - useful for unchartered territory e.g., you need to manipulate camera streams before they are rendered.

# Basic Usage

## `DualCameraScreen` - drop-in, full-screen component

```swift
struct ContentView: View {

    var body: some View {
        DualCameraScreen(
            layout: .fullScreenWithMini(
                miniCamera: .front,
                miniCameraPosition: .bottomTrailing
            )
        )
    }

}
```

# Camera Layout Types

```swift
public enum DualCameraLayout {
    case sideBySide
    case stackedVertical
    case piP(miniCamera: DualCameraSource, miniCameraPosition: MiniCameraPosition)
}
```

> Note: these screenshots are using colors to mock the front (purple) and back (yellow) cameras â€“ this is how we're mocking things in the simulator because it doesn't have a hardware camera.

## `.piP(miniCamera:, miniCameraPosition:)`

|                                                                                                       |                                                                                                         |

# Video Capture Modes

- This library offers several implementations of `DualCameraVideoRecorderType` that offer various methods of capturing.
- You can choose which type you'd like by invoking `DualCameraControlling.startVideoRecording(recorderType:)`

| Type                    | Quality |                   Description                   |      Core Technology       |          Permissions Required           |                       Layout Dependence                       | Implementation Status |
| ----------------------- | :-----: | :---------------------------------------------: | :------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------: |
| `.cpuBased`             | Medium  |          Takes continuous screenshots           | `DualCameraPhotoCapturing` |            Camera (one-time)            |                 Captures screen layout as-is                  |          âœ…           |
| `.replayKit`            |  High   |           System screen recording API           |         ReplayKit          | Camera (one-time) + ReplayKit (per-use) |                 Captures screen layout as-is                  |          âœ…           |
| `.gpuBasedUncomposited` |  High   |              Direct Metal capture               |   Metal/GPU acceleration   |            Camera (one-time)            |  Produces separate video streams (manual composition needed)  |          ðŸš§           |
| `.gpuBasedComposited`   |  High   | Direct Metal capture with automatic composition |   Metal/GPU acceleration   |            Camera (one-time)            | Automatically composes videos according to `DualCameraLayout` |          ðŸš§           |

# Customization

# Troubleshooting

# Deep Dives

- ðŸš§ Explain our different approaches (dual streams) vs. `PiPVideoMixer` (single stream) vs `ReplayKit` (screen capture, requires user permission each time)
- ðŸš§ Add some diagrams

# Limitations

- The library works fully on-device only! Limited, non-camera use in simulator (including previews).
  - Why? Because the simulator doesn't have access to camera.
  - It runs in simulator & previews using mocked implementations for the cameras. The goal here is to allow you to integrate as much as possible using previews, for example, iterating on layouts.
  - You should still test on-device as part of your full testing flow to ensure things work as you expect.
- iOS only. iPad support is a future enhancement. Other platforms only have one camera

# References

Part of this project was adapted from Apple's code in [`AVMultiCamPiP: Capturing from Multiple Cameras`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avmulticampip-capturing-from-multiple-cameras). Some significant updates here: this library ported the functionality to SwiftUI, including using a dual-stream approach vs. Apple's approach of mixing together both streams into a single CVPixelBuffer containing both camera sources.

Looking at this table, I think some additional columns would help clarify the differences between recorder types and avoid redundancy. Here's my suggestion for an improved table structure:
